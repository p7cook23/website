<p>Andy Murray is a Scottish tennis player. He was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1987. 
  He is a professional tennis player who has won three Grand Slam titles which include
  two at Wimbledon and one at the US Open. He plays mostly singles tennis, but is also
  known for playing doubles tennis. In addition to Andy Murray, his brother Jamie Murray
  is also a skilled and professional tennis player, but is more known for doubles tennis. 
<br/>
I chose Andy Murray as my hero because of his dedication to the tennis world. When I 
  was younger I would spend Sunday afternoons watching him play at Wimbledon or the 
  open at the time. I think that it is important for young people to see others who 
  have such strong dedication to a sport or passion. Also, in recent years he has not
  been able to play as much as he wants to due to injury, yet is still trying to 
  continue to play. I think that the love he shows for tennis inspires me to find
  something that I can feel that passionately about.
