/*
	this is a block comment
		write out algorithim that would prompt a user to guess a number 
		between 1 and 10. should tell the user if the guess is to high 
		or low. if the guess is correct, the program should alert how 
		many guesses it took. 
		1. have a button introducing the game - 
		2. use a variable to create a random number between one and ten 
		3. create a button and variable that would let the user type in a number 
		4. compare that to the number 
		5. then create an alert that states whether it was greater or less than 
		the random number 
		6. if the number is correct than create an alert stating if the value guesses was correct
		7.  say that the number of guesses it took 
		
		create a variable for the user's answer
		create a variable for the random number 
		create a variable for the number of guesses
		create an alert if correct 
		create an alert for the number of guesses 
		create a condition to test if the answer was too low - update user
		create a condition to test if the answer was too high - update user
		store a random number in rand number variable 
		create a loop until the answer is correct
